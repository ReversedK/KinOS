# KinOS — MVP Implementation Progress

Tracks the autonomous MVP implementation loop (`docs/implementation/mvp-loop.md`).
Goal: reach the MVP validation criteria of `docs/contracts/results-contract.md`
§19 without violating the invariants or coding principles.

## Current state

Spec-only repo. Iteration 1 establishes the implementation stack (doc-before-code:
the stack choice itself required an accepted ADR — none existed).

## Stack decisions (ADR-006)

- Language/runtime: **TypeScript on Node.js**; pure domain core, no provider/IO imports.
- Local model runtime (§19): **Ollama** behind a runtime adapter.
- Persistence: **SQLite** behind repository ports; embeddings derived/regenerable.
- First surface: **domain API + thin CLI**; Next.js UI deferred.
- Layout: npm-workspaces monorepo — `packages/core`, `packages/adapters/*`,
  `packages/app/*`, `ui/`. Test runner: Vitest. `tsc --strict`.
- Environment: **Docker only** — no host node/npm. Run via
  `docker compose run --rm dev npm <cmd>`.

## Dependency order being followed

Identity/Sphere/Member → Policy Engine → Memory → Capabilities/Bindings →
Runtime adapter → integrations/Packages → UI.

## §19 MVP criteria checklist

- [ ] a Sphere can be created
- [ ] two adults and one child can be added
- [ ] each member can have an agent
- [ ] the child cannot access private adult memory
- [ ] memory can be shared and revoked
- [ ] a capability can be allowed for an adult and denied to a child
- [ ] a sensitive action can trigger approval
- [ ] the system runs with a local model runtime
- [ ] data can be exported

## Log

### Iteration 1 — 2026-06-25
- **Done:** Wrote and accepted `docs/adr/006-implementation-stack.md` (TS/Node,
  Ollama, SQLite, API/CLI-first, npm-workspaces monorepo, Vitest, strict TS).
  Confirmed the four open stack decisions with the human before writing.
- **Decisions:** see Stack decisions above.
- **Next step:** Scaffold the monorepo (root `package.json` workspaces, `tsconfig`
  base, Vitest config, empty `packages/core`) and prove the toolchain with one
  trivial failing→passing test. Then begin the first domain slice: Identity /
  Sphere / Member value objects + creation, TDD, with a failing test encoding
  "a Sphere can be created" and "two adults and one child can be added".

### Iteration 2 — 2026-06-25
- **Done:** Scaffolded npm-workspaces monorepo (root `package.json`,
  `tsconfig.base.json` strict, root `tsconfig.json` project refs, `vitest.config.ts`,
  `packages/core`). Proved the toolchain with a red→green test
  (`CORE_CONTRACT_VERSION`). Pivoted the toolchain to **Docker** per human
  instruction: added `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.gitignore`; removed host
  `node_modules`. All commands now run via `docker compose run --rm dev …`.
- **Verified (in container):** `npm test` → 1 passed; `npm run typecheck` → exit 0.
- **Decisions:** Docker is the dev/run environment (ADR-006 "Dev and run
  environment"); Node stays the runtime.
- **Next step:** First domain slice — Identity / Sphere / Member. TDD: failing
  test encoding §19 "a Sphere can be created" and "two adults + one child added",
  modelling roles (parent/child) per results-contract §3 and domain-model.md.
  Pure `packages/core`, no I/O.
